My Vim Journey
===============

I think 3 or 4 years ago, I already interested in Vim. Don't ask why I didn't chose
Emacs--because at that moment it looks too complicated for me.  Okay let's back to
Vim what we are talking about now.

In the first time I saw the video about how people using Vim, I feel it's something 
like magic, and it looks like so fast and we can completely control the things what 
we are writing/editing. Another part that I like Vim is that it is so simple and fast
and don't take too much resources to use it, and I was with a kind of old computer.
Anyway I just fall in love with this editor and I was trying a lot of things about Vim.

But because I was in school and lots of the things we need to do can not be done with
my level of Vim, and I don't want to be left behind, so using Vim is a kind of hobby for
me to play or to try something new. And this continues in my school time, but I am always
use Vim to write some small documents. Because most of the lauguage we study in school
is about Java or C#, these kinds of languages is hard to write without specific IDE, so
Vim can never be used with the project we do in school,  my level of Vim is stucked in 
a level of just know how to move the words and lines, and simple edit like any other 
editors, some times I even doubt whether I am not good or Vim is not like people said.

After graduate, my first job is to work with EBS, oh my god, this is never the place 
that vim can be used, we need specific Environment and IDE of course. I really don't
like this kind of programming things. I don't like a language that have to be used in
a specific environment and don't have alternative choice, please no.

Around one years later, I quit that job because of some reason--not the programming language. 
And then I am working on the place where I am working now, the language we use is Java and Eclipse IDE of course.
But we are using a Linux OS and there is something we need to do in terminal, and the most
important for me is free. I am doing my work and at rest time I am trying to using Vim to do work.
And also I am even trying to use Vim to replace my Eclipse IDE, I did a lot of works, but 
it looks like and IDE for starting new project is better, for review code and little edit
Vim is good. 
And also during this period, I reviewed my python skill, and I found using Vim to do Python programming is very good.
As Python is not like Java that relies on many of the jar libs, 
and also almost every linunx OS native support Python both 2.x and 3.x.

And now I can use Vim as much as I can, and the more I learn the more I enjoy and the moreI don't know.

I really respect the author of Vim and the plugins authors, I got this spirit of free.

As 1900 said, "I donnot how to play music on the earth, only God can play music with such
a big land. I just can use limited keyboard to play the infinite music!"

Programming is not something about editor, is something about the thought and the code,
and Vim provide a limited tool set that you can do almost everything.

And now I am on the journey of Vimmer.

Cheers.
